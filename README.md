# Invisible-Cloak-Using-Python
Application of Python's OpenCV Library to detect a layer of red coloured cloth against previously captured background, with overall effect of an invisible cloak.

# Requirements:
Install opencv. Refer to https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

# Modules:
get_background.py file captures your background on pressing the key "q" and saves it as "image.jpg". 
invisible_cloak.py file detects the red coloured cloth, highlights it and replaces the highlighted area with the same area from previously saved image.jpg image.
First, run get_background.py. Without moving your device, run invisible_cloak.py, cover yourself with a red cloth and feel the magic of Hogwarts as the overall effect of an invisible cloak is created.
